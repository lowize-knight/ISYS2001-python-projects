This project collates many of the exercises from this week’s activities. This is intentional—by combining these exercises, you can reflect on your progress and see how well you’re following the industry best practices we espouse. These practices include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaningful Notebook Naming:** Give your notebook a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `finance_tracker_profile_setup.ipynb`).\n",
        "- **Frequent Saves & Version Control:** Save your work often and use descriptive commit messages when uploading to GitHub.\n",
        "- **Descriptive Variable Names:** Use names like `user_name`, `theme_color`, etc., to clearly convey their purpose.\n",
        "- **Code Comments & Documentation:** Use text cells and inline comments to document your thought process.\n",
        "- **Critical Use of AI:** Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear, and verify that AI suggestions align with the basics you’ve learnt (i.e., using input(), print(), basic data types, and variables).\n",
